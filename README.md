Shell Scripts

All of the shell scripts include a -h option which explains their usage syntax.

For the create user script, ensure you run the script with sudo and without any arguements.
You will be prompted to enter a username and password of your choice.

For the replace spaces script, if you include the -c option you can specify an underscore or a hyphen, followed by a file or directory.
Excluding the -c option entirely and including a file or directory will set the special character as an underscore by default.

For the reminder script, running the script without any arguements will enter interactive mode, which will write to the reminders file until the user pressed Ctrl+D.
Using the -f option will specify a search term. Including the -f option without any search term returns the entire contents of the reminders file.
If the -f option is omitted entirely, the script will take all arguements and write them to the reminders file.
